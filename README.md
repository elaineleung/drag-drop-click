# Drag-Drop-Click

## A component for file upload using either drag-and-drop or click

Built with Next.js

This is just a very simple component for uploading one file, as the intention was to create a barebones component with room for add-ons. The goal here also is to not use additional packages and libraries.

## Quick start guide

  1. Clone the repo
  2. Run `npm` to install the project dependencies
  3. Run `npm run dev` to start the project.
